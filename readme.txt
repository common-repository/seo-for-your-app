Adds SEO Deeplinking Capability For Your App To Your Site

== Description ==

This plugin inserts the necessary codes into your website to let Google know about your deep indexing capabilities of your [Blappsta](http://www.blappsta.com) app. This increases your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of your app and site / blog.
Since G[oogle now supports deep linking for apps](https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/) it is very relevant to have an own native app along with your website / blog. As [Blappsta](http://www.blappsta.com) provides native apps based on your WordPress site / blog you can now easily add the header tag into your website supporting deep linking.  
If you don’t have an own app yet, please visit [Blappsta](http://www.blappsta.com) to setup your own native app.
